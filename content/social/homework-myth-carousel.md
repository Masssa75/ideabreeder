## Caption

```
35 years of research. Zero benefit.

In 1989, researcher Harris Cooper analyzed every homework study he could find. His conclusion was clear: homework doesn't improve academic performance for elementary students.

For third graders, more homework actually meant WORSE grades.

So what does work?
✓ Family dinner conversations
✓ Reading aloud (even to older kids)
✓ Unstructured play
✓ Sleep

The real cost of homework isn't just wasted time—it's the stress, the tears, and the family conflict it creates.

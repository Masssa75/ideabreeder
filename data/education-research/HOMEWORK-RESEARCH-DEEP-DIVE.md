# Homework Research Deep Dive

## The Juiciest Findings (with Sources)

These are the most shocking, citation-worthy findings from actual peer-reviewed research. Each can be used as a standalone fact in blog posts, social media, or carousels.

### 1. NAEP Data: More Homework = Worse Scores (4th Grade)

**The Finding:**
Fourth-graders who did NO homework scored roughly the SAME on the NAEP math exam as those doing 30 minutes per night. Students doing 45+ minutes scored **WORSE**.

**Why It's Shocking:**
This is from the National Assessment of Educational Progress - the "Nation's Report Card" - not some fringe study. The U.S. government's own data shows homework hurts young kids.

### 2. Cooper's Meta-Analysis: Homework = Less Than 4% of Test Score Differences

**The Finding:**
Even when correlations exist, homework accounts for **less than 4%** of the variance in student achievement scores. (Derived from average correlation of +.19, squared.)

**Why It's Shocking:**
This comes from Harris Cooper - the researcher most often cited BY homework proponents. Even his own data shows the effect is tiny.

**The Kicker:**
Cooper himself admits: "It is equally plausible that teachers assign more homework to students who are achieving better... or that better students simply spend more time on home study."

### 3. 50-Country TIMSS Study: ALL Correlations Were NEGATIVE

**The Finding:**
Researchers analyzing TIMSS data from 50 countries found: "Not only did we fail to find any positive relationships, but the overall correlations between national average student achievement and national averages in homework assigned are **all negative**."

**Why It's Shocking:**
Countries that assign MORE homework have LOWER achievement. The researchers concluded: "Countries that try to improve their standing by raising the amount of homework might actually be undermining their own success."

### 4. Third Graders: Negative Correlation (More Homework = Lower Achievement)

**The Finding:**
For third graders specifically, the correlations between homework and achievement were **negative** - more homework was associated with **lower** achievement.

**Why It's Shocking:**
It's not just "no benefit" - it's actively harmful for this age group.

### 5. Exceptional Teachers Give LESS Homework

**The Finding:**
When researcher Ruth Tschudin identified ~300 "A+ teachers" based on awards, recommendations, and media recognition, she found they **gave less homework** than average teachers - and gave students **more choices** about their assignments.

**Why It's Shocking:**
The teachers recognized as exceptional are doing the opposite of what most schools mandate.

### 6. Family Fights 200% More Likely (Without College Degree)

**The Finding:**
Family fights about homework were **200% more likely** when parents didn't have a college degree.

**Additional Finding:**
Kindergarteners receive 25 minutes of homework per night on average - when the NEA says they should receive **ZERO**.

**Why It's Shocking:**
Homework doesn't just fail to help - it actively harms family relationships, and disproportionately burdens less privileged families.

### 7. Stanford Study: 56% Say Homework is Primary Stress Source

**The Finding:**
56% of students considered homework their **primary source of stress** (more than tests at 43%, more than grade pressure at 33%). Less than 1% said homework was NOT a stressor.

**Additional Finding:**
More than 2 hours of homework per night is associated with depression, sleep problems, and worse outcomes.

**Why It's Shocking:**
Over half of students identify homework as their #1 stressor - not tests, not social pressure, not grades.

### 8. Top Math Countries Have BELOW-Average Homework

**The Finding:**
Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan - countries that topped TIMSS math rankings - reported homework loads **below the international average**.

**Why It's Shocking:**
The countries we think of as "rigorous" actually assign less homework than we do.

### 9. Harvard Study: Homework Effect "Disappeared"

**The Finding:**
A study initially showing a small relationship between high school homework and college physics performance found that the effect **completely disappeared** when controlling for other variables (instruction quality, motivation, course selection).

**Why It's Shocking:**
Even the studies that seem to support homework often fall apart under scrutiny.

**Source:**
- Cited in [Alfie Kohn's comprehensive review](https://www.alfiekohn.org/homework-improve-learning/)
- Keith, T.Z. (1980s studies) - original positive findings became "spurious" with proper controls

### 10. Elementary School: "No Evidence of Any Academic Benefit"

**The Finding:**
"There is no evidence that any amount of homework improves the academic performance of elementary students." - Harris Cooper, Duke University (1989)

**The 2006 Update:**
Cooper's updated meta-analysis confirmed: for elementary school students, the correlation between homework and achievement "hovered around no relationship at all."

**Why It's Shocking:**
The world's leading homework researcher - who is generally PRO-homework - says this. It's not contested.

## Additional Juicy Stats

### On Non-Academic "Benefits" (There Aren't Any)
"There isn't a shred of evidence to support the widely accepted assumption that homework yields nonacademic benefits for students of any age. The idea that homework teaches good work habits or develops positive character traits (such as self-discipline and independence) could be described as an urban myth."
- [Alfie Kohn](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/truth-homework/)

### On Homework Equity
"The highest homework loads are associated with countries that have lower incomes and higher social inequality."
- Baker & LeTendre (2005)

### The "Goldilocks Zone" (High School Only)
For high school students, benefits plateau at 90 minutes to 2.5 hours. After that, returns diminish or become negative.
- [Stanford GSE Research](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/more-two-hours-homework-may-be-counterproductive-research-suggests)

### American Students vs. Peers
"American students appear to do as much homework as their peers overseas—if not more—but still only score around the international average."
- Gerald LeTendre, Penn State

## TIER 1: Mind-Blowing (Stop Scrolling Material)

### 1. More Schooling = Worse Math (Indonesia Study)
**Source:** [RISE Programme - Indonesia](https://riseprogramme.org/blog/indonesian_students_worse_mathematics.html)

> "The average child in Grade 7 in 2014 achieved the same numeracy mastery as the average child in Grade 4 in 2000."

**The Details:**
- Between 2000-2014, Indonesia massively expanded education
- Secondary school completion increased by 20 percentage points
- Education spending nearly DOUBLED
- Student-teacher ratio dropped to 16:1 (one of lowest in region)
- Teachers with bachelor's degrees rose from 37% to 90%
- **Result: Math performance DECLINED by 1/4 of a standard deviation**

**Hook angles:**
- "Indonesia doubled education spending. Kids got worse at math."
- "More teachers. More money. More school. Worse results."
- "28% of high school graduates can only do 1st grade math."

### 2. One-Third of Feedback Hurts Kids
**Source:** [Hattie & Timperley / Frontiers in Psychology Meta-Analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6987456/)

> "About a third of the effects were negative." - Kluger and DeNisi (1996), 131 studies

**The Details:**
- Feedback is ranked #2 most effective intervention
- But 1/3 of studies showed feedback HURT learning
- 21% of feedback interventions had negative motivational effects
- 86% of those negative effects came from praise, rewards, and punishment
- **Praise for struggling students signals to them that the teacher thinks they're dumb**

**Hook angles:**
- "The #2 best teaching method hurts kids 1/3 of the time."
- "Being nice to struggling students can make them worse."
- "Praise has zero-to-negative impact on improving work."

### 3. More Homework = Lower Grades (For Young Kids)
**Source:** [Cooper et al. Meta-Analysis](https://sedl.org/pubs/sedl-letter/v20n02/homework.html)

> "For third graders, the correlations were negative: more homework was associated with lower achievement."

**The Details:**
- 35 correlational studies found NO relationship between homework and achievement in elementary school
- For 3rd graders specifically, MORE homework = WORSE grades
- Cooper (1989): "There is no evidence that any amount of homework improves the academic performance of elementary students."
- Even in high school, benefits max out at 2 hours

**Hook angles:**
- "More homework. Lower grades. (For kids under 10)"
- "We've known since 1989 that homework doesn't help young kids."
- "The research is clear. We just keep ignoring it."

### 4. California Spent $1 Billion/Year. Nothing Changed.
**Source:** [Hechinger Report / Hanushek Research](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-pandemic-relief-money-is-flowing-to-class-size-reduction-but-research-evidence-for-it-isnt-strong/)

> "Billions of dollars are spent each year to fund smaller class sizes... this investment may not have had a large impact on California students' learning."

**The Details:**
- Tennessee STAR study showed smaller classes work (13-17 students)
- California implemented it at scale: 30 → 20 students
- Cost: Over $1 billion per year
- Result: Nothing close to the original study's effects
- The original study worked with 13-17 kids. California did 20. No benefits above 15 students in some research.

**Hook angles:**
- "$1 billion per year. No measurable improvement."
- "The study said 15 kids. We put in 20. Didn't work."
- "Politicians spent the money. Kids didn't benefit."

## TIER 2: Strong Counterintuitive (High Engagement)

### 5. Finland: 30 Minutes of Homework. Top Scores.
**Source:** [World Economic Forum / OECD](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2018/09/10-reasons-why-finlands-education-system-is-the-best-in-the-world/)

**The Details:**
- Finnish students: 30 minutes homework/day average
- US/Asian students: 2-3 hours/day
- Finland: No standardized tests until end of high school
- Primary students: 10-20 minutes homework/day MAX
- Short school days with multiple breaks for play
- **Consistently top 10 PISA scores**

**Hook angles:**
- "Finnish kids do 30 min of homework. Yours do 3 hours. Who learns more?"
- "Less school. Less homework. Better results."

### 6. $8 Billion in "Evidence-Based" Grants = Disappointment
**Source:** [Education Next](https://www.educationnext.org/problem-education-research-fixated-on-what-works/)

> "$8 billion in School Improvement Grants disappointed despite research showing improvement approaches 'work.'"

**The Details:**
- US government spent $8 billion on School Improvement Grants
- All based on "what works" research
- Results did not materialize at scale
- On average, education initiatives have very little to no impact (Sheffield Hallam University)

### 7. Reading Programs Don't Work (Despite 40 Years of Research)
**Source:** [The Conversation / Sheffield Hallam University](https://theconversation.com/schools-are-using-research-to-try-to-improve-childrens-learning-but-its-not-working-226348)

> "Reading abilities have not changed much in the UK for decades."

**The Details:**
- Reading is the most heavily researched area (40%+ of all education studies)
- Most schools have implemented "evidence-based" reading programs
- Outcomes haven't improved
- Research messages too vague to be effective

### 8. The #1 Method Isn't Even Properly Defined
**Source:** [Dinsmore et al. / Rethinking-Ed](https://www.rethinking-ed.org/the-frog-model-of-srl)

> "Only 49% of the studies provided explicit definitions" - Review of 250+ metacognition studies

**The Details:**
- Metacognition is ranked #1 most effective (+8 months)
- But researchers can't even agree on what it means
- EEF defines it as "learning to learn" - critics say that's wrong
- Takes 2-4 years to properly implement

## TIER 3: Specific & Quotable

### 9. Hattie's Decade-Long Mistake
**Source:** [EdWeek Interview with John Hattie](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/getting-feedback-right-a-q-a-with-john-hattie/2018/06)

> "I used to think giving more feedback and better feedback was the answer, and it's the exact opposite."

- The world's most-cited education researcher
- Spent a decade thinking about feedback wrong
- Real question: How do students RECEIVE feedback?

---

### 10. Productive Frustration
**Source:** [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-bring-new-rigor-to-education-research/)

> "There are levels of frustration and failure that are very productive, are very good ways to learn."

- Parents don't like seeing kids frustrated
- Research shows struggle improves learning
- Students more engaged when assignments are challenging

## Best Hook Combinations

### For "What Actually Works" Carousel:

**Option A (Money angle):**
> "Indonesia doubled education spending. Kids got worse at math. Here's what actually works."

**Option B (Homework angle):**
> "For kids under 10, more homework = lower grades. We've known this since 1989."

**Option C (Feedback angle):**
> "The #2 best teaching method hurts kids 1/3 of the time. (If done wrong.)"

**Option D (Finland angle):**
> "Finnish kids do 30 min homework. American kids do 3 hours. Same test scores."

**Option E (Billion dollar angle):**
> "California spent $1 billion/year on smaller classes. Results: Nothing."

**Option F (System failure angle):**
> "$8 billion in 'evidence-based' education grants. The research said it would work. It didn't."

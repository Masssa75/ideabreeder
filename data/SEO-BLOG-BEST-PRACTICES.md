## 1. Word Count Guidelines

| Content Type | Recommended Length |
|--------------|-------------------|
| News articles | 750-1,000 words |
| How-to guides | 1,500-2,500 words |
| Product reviews | 1,500-2,500 words |
| In-depth guides | 2,500-4,000 words |
| Minimum for any post | 300 words |

**Key insight:** Average top-ranking post is 1,447 words (Backlinko study). But quality beats length—a well-structured 1,000-word post can outrank a messy 3,000-word article.

---

## 2. Headlines / Title Tags

### Rules
- **Length:** 50-60 characters (Google cuts off longer titles)
- **Keyword placement:** Include primary keyword early
- **Use numbers:** Improves click-through rate
- **Emotional words:** Capture attention, prompt clicks

### Proven Headline Formulas
- "How to + Benefit"
- "Number + Specific Promise" (e.g., "7 Ways to...")
- "Problem → Outcome"
- Question headlines that match search queries

### CTR Stats
- Position 1 average CTR: 31.7%
- Featured snippet CTR: 35.1%
- Higher CTR → Google ranks you higher (feedback loop)

---

## 3. Meta Descriptions

- **Length:** Up to 155 characters
- **Include:** Primary keyword, value proposition, call-to-action
- **Purpose:** Convince searchers to click (not direct ranking factor, but affects CTR)

---

## 4. URL Structure

- **Keep URLs short** — analysis of 11.8 million results found short URLs rank best
- **Include keyword**
- **Use hyphens** to separate words
- **Avoid:** dates, unnecessary words, parameters

**Good:** `/homework-myth-research`
**Bad:** `/2025/12/16/blog-post-about-why-homework-doesnt-work-for-kids`

---

## 5. Heading Structure

- **One H1 per page** (your title)
- **H2s for main sections**
- **H3s for subsections** under H2s
- **Include keywords naturally** in headings
- **Use question-format headings** for featured snippet targeting

### For Featured Snippets
Frame H2/H3 as questions: "What is X?" or "How to Y?"
Follow immediately with 40-60 word direct answer.

---

## 6. Internal Linking

### Guidelines
- **2-5 internal links per 1,000 words**
- **5-10 links for a 2,000-word post**
- **Max total links per page:** 50-150 (including nav, footer)
- **Keep pages within 3 clicks of homepage** — pages at depth 4+ get 9x less traffic

### Best Practices
- Link to relevant, related content
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link from high-authority pages to new content
- Update old posts to link to new content

---

## 7. Featured Snippets (Position Zero)

### Why It Matters
- Featured snippet CTR: 35.1% (higher than position 1)
- 40% of voice assistant answers come from featured snippets
- Can gain 31% more traffic ranking both position 1 and featured snippet

### Types
1. **Paragraph** (40-60 words) — for "what is" queries
2. **Numbered list** — for step-by-step processes
3. **Bulleted list** — for non-ordered items
4. **Table** — for comparative data

### How to Optimize
1. Target question-based, long-tail keywords
2. Use H2/H3 headings formatted as questions
3. Answer directly in first 40-60 words after heading
4. Use lists and tables where appropriate
5. Add FAQ or HowTo schema markup

### Requirement
99% of featured snippets come from pages already ranking in top 10. You need to rank first, then optimize for the snippet.

---

## 8. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

Google's quality guidelines emphasize:
- **Experience:** First-hand knowledge of the topic
- **Expertise:** Demonstrated skill/knowledge
- **Authoritativeness:** Recognition as a go-to source
- **Trustworthiness:** Accurate, honest, safe content

### For Parenting/Education Blogs
- Cite research and studies
- Include author bio with credentials
- Link to authoritative sources
- Keep content updated (show "Last Updated" dates)
- Be transparent about who you are

**Warning:** Google's March 2024 update penalized 87% of YMYL (Your Money Your Life) sites lacking first-hand expertise.

---

## 9. Parenting/Education Niche Keywords

### Keyword Strategy
- **Avoid:** Broad terms like "parenting" (too competitive)
- **Target:** Long-tail keywords with lower competition
- 69% of search traffic comes from long-tail keywords

### Example Keywords for Your Niche
- "homework doesn't help elementary students"
- "alternative education phuket"
- "outdoor school benefits research"
- "finland education system homework"
- "what helps kids learn research"

### Tools
- Google Keyword Planner (free)
- Ahrefs
- Ubersuggest
- Google Trends
- AlsoAsked (for question-based queries)
